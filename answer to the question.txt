Q1: How does the Prophet Algorithm differ from an LSTM?

Prophet and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) are both algorithms used for time series forecasting, but they differ in their approach and the type of problem they solve.

Prophet is a univariate time series forecasting model developed by Facebook, which is based on decomposing the time series into trend, seasonality and holiday components.
It is best suited for modeling trends with strong seasonality and for analyzing time series data that has a clear trend and yearly or weekly seasonality.
On the other hand, LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to handle sequential data, such as time series data. LSTMs are best suited for modeling time series data with complex patterns, 
such as long-term dependencies, as they have memory cells that can store historical information and use it to make predictions.

Q1:Why does an LSTM have poor performance against ARIMA and Profit for Time Series?

LSTMs may have poor performance compared to ARIMA and Prophet:

Data Characteristics: LSTMs perform best when the time series data has complex patterns, such as long-term dependencies. 
If the data is simple, with a clear trend and seasonality, ARIMA and Prophet, which are specialized algorithms for time series forecasting with clear patterns, may perform better.

Model Hyperparameter Tuning: LSTMs require careful tuning of their hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden units and the number of time steps to consider.
 If the hyperparameters are not properly set, the performance of the LSTM may be poor.

Training Data Size: LSTMs are deep learning models and require a large amount of training data to perform well. If the training data size is too small, the performance of the LSTM may be poor.

Overfitting: LSTMs are prone to overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data and does not generalize well to new data. 
To avoid overfitting, it is important to use regularization techniques, such as dropout, and to monitor the performance on a validation set.

Q2:What is exponential smoothing and why is it used in Time Series Forecasting?

Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method that uses a weighted average of past observations to make predictions. 
The weight assigned to each past observation decreases exponentially, so that more recent observations are given more weight and older observations are given less weight.

Q3: What is seasonality? Why Is Stationarity Important in Time Series Forecasting?

Seasonality refers to the recurring patterns in a time series data that can be attributed to regular events or cycles, such as annual patterns in sales data due to holiday shopping.

Stationarity is important in time series forecasting because most statistical methods for time series analysis and forecasting are based on the assumption of stationarity,
 meaning that the statistical properties of the series are constant over time. Stationary time series have a constant mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure, 
which makes it easier to model and make predictions. Non-stationary time series are often more difficult to model and can lead to inaccurate forecasting results.

Seasonality is predictable, whereas cyclicality is not.
